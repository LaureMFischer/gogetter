# GoGetter - Boston

* GoGetter is a version of an app that I developed in collaboration with two classmates ([tsyan](http://github.com/tsyan), [higginsmt](http://github.com/higginsmt)) as part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. We built the original app in one week, and I have continued to make updates to my own version independently.

* This app was developed with the goal of enabling users to get past their indecisiveness when it comes to experiencing their city. While there is no shortage of information about things to do in Boston, the sheer volume of 'Best of' lists and travel websites out there can make it difficult to settle on something to do, particularly something spontaneous and inexpensive.

* GoGetter is a quick and easy way to find something to do today in Boston. Just click the "What should I do today?" button to display a single, simple idea for something to do, submitted by other users who want to share their favorite experiences. When you see one you like, click the "Do it!" button to dive in! After you're done, you'll be prompted to share a story about your experience, which might inspire others to get out there and have their own adventure!
