how to do bootstrap, from mike at lunch

-----------------------------

get the bootstrap sass gem:

  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass

in Gemfile:

 gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.1.1'
 (don't need sass-rails gem)

 remember to bundle!

in application.css

  rename the file to application.css.scss
  add:
     @import "bootstrap";

in application.js

  add (before //= require tree):
    //= require bootstrap

-----------------------------



as long as the browser is bigger than size "sm" then it will take up the number of columns specified (out of 12)

to center a column, set the offset number of columns to the left
